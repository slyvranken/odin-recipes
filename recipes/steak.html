        <h3>A delicious and nutritious steak recipe with spinach to make you strong.</h3>
        <p>This steak recipe has great balance with vegetables while adding some flavor with a nice light sauce on the veggies.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz frozen chopped spinach</li>
            <li>8 fl oz heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 shallots</li>
            <li>16 oz sliced white mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb New York strip steak</li>
            <li>salt, black pepper, and garlic powder, to taste</li>
            <li>butter, unsalted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>While the skillet heats up, pat the steak dry with paper towels and place on a plate. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Once the skillet is hot, add butter and swirl to coat the bottom. Add steak and cook until desired doneness, 2-5 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a clean plate, loosely cover with aluminum foil, and set aside to rest.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place spinach in a colander and rinse under hot, running water (from the tap) to defrost; set aside to drain further.</li>
            <li>Peel and mince shallots.</li>
            <li>When the steak is done, wipe the skillet clean with paper towels. Return to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the skillet is hot, add more butter and swirl to coat the bottom. Add shallot and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms soften, 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add spinach, cream, and spices to the skillet; stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and cook until spinach is warmed through and sauce thickens slightly, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice steak against the grain.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide steak and creamy veggie saute between plates. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
