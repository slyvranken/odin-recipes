            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup white rice</li>
                <li>8 fl oz chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 cups frozen butternut squash pieces</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 or 15 oz whole rotisserie chicken</li>
                <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>stir-fry sauce</li>
                <li>toasted sesame oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using a strainer or colander, rinse the rice under cold, running water, then drain and transfer to a small saucepan. Add broth, then bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.</li>
                <li>Once the liquid comes to a boil, stir the mixture, cover the saucepan, and reduce heat to low. Cook rice until liquid is fully absorbed, 15-18 minutes. Once done, remove rice from the heat and let it stand, still covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place chicken on a cutting board and, using your hands, remove meat from the skin and bones. Separate the meat into shred-like pieces, place in a medium bowl, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Wash and dry bell peppers. Using a clean cutting board, trim, seed, and halve crosswise; slice each half into thin strips. Place in another medium bowl along with the butternut squash.</li>
                <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>While the skillet heats up, peel, halve, and slice onion crosswise into thin half-moons. Add to the bowl with the bell pepper and squash.</li>
                <li>Once the skillet is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add veggies, cover with a lid, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the veggies are done, add chicken and stir-fry sauce to the skillet. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken and sauce are warmed through, 1-2 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>To serve, divide rice and stir-fry between plates or bowls. Enjoy!</li>
