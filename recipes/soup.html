        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks celery</li>
            <li>24 fl oz chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 lb ground turkey</li>
            <li>5 oz shredded carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded cheese, Mexican blend</li>
            <li>4 fl oz whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 medium yellow potatoes</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash, dry, and medium dice potatoes. Place in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Wash, dry, trim, and small dice celery. Add to the bowl with the potatoes and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>    
            <li>Once the pan is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add turkey, salt, and pepper; cook, breaking the meat apart with a spoon, until browned and crumbly, 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel, halve, and small dice onion. Add to the bowl with the potato and celery along with the carrots.</li>
            <li>When the turkey is done, add veggies to the pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add broth to the pan; stir to combine the soup, then bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until veggies are tender, 12-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the veggies are soft, add milk and cheese. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is melted and combined, 1-2 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide soup between bowls and enjoy!</li>
